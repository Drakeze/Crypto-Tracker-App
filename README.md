# 🪙 Crypto Tracker App

A modern cryptocurrency tracking application built with **Next.js**, focused on clean architecture, external API integration, and production-ready workflows.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Crypto Tracker App displays real-time cryptocurrency market data through a responsive web interface.

This project was built as part of my professional portfolio to demonstrate how I approach:

- Frontend architecture  
- API integration  
- Deployment-ready application design  

The emphasis is on **clarity, maintainability, and real-world development patterns**, rather than feature overload.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency market data  
- External API integration  
- Responsive, modern UI  
- Environment-based configuration  
- Deployed production build  

---

## 🌐 External Data Source

This application retrieves market data from the **CoinGecko API**:

🔗 [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)

CoinGecko provides free, reliable cryptocurrency market data and is commonly used in production and portfolio-grade applications.

## 🧠 Development Approach

This project follows a **tool-assisted, developer-led workflow**.

### UI Exploration & Mockups
- Initial layout inspiration and component ideas explored using v0.dev  
- Final structure, styling decisions, and integration handled manually  

### AI-Assisted Review & Optimization
- Codex was used for refactoring suggestions, optimization checks, and code review  
- All logic, architecture, and final implementations were reviewed and validated by me  

### API Validation
- API endpoints were tested and verified using Postman  
- Data handling and state flow were implemented manually within the application  

AI and tooling were used to **increase development efficiency**, not replace engineering judgment.

> ## ▶️ Running the Project Locally
> 
> This project uses **Bun** as the runtime and package manager.
> 
> **Install Dependencies**
> ```bash
> bun install
> ```
> 
> **Start Development Server**
> ```bash
> bun dev
> ```
> 
> **Build for Production**
> ```bash
> bun run build
> ```
> 
> **Start Production Server**
> ```bash
> bun start
> ```

Environment variables are used for configuration and should be defined locally when running the project.

## 🔄 How the Application Works

- Cryptocurrency market data is fetched from the CoinGecko API  
- Data-fetching logic is isolated from UI components  
- UI components consume normalized data  
- Environment variables manage configuration  
- The application is deployed with production-safe defaults  

---

## 📍 Current Status

- Core functionality implemented  
- Fully deployed and accessible  
- Actively maintained  

This project is intentionally kept focused and stable.

---

## 🧭 Planned Improvements

Future iterations will introduce backend persistence and expanded data handling:

- Prisma ORM  
- MongoDB database integration  
- Improved caching and historical data storage  

These components are **planned but not yet implemented**.

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

Portions of this project were developed with AI assistance, including code suggestions, refactoring support, and optimization checks.

All architectural decisions, integrations, and final code were reviewed, modified, and approved by the author.

AI was used as a productivity tool—not a substitute for engineering skill.
